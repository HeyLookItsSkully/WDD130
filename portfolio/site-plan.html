        Welcome to my photography page! I picked up my first camera more than 15 years ago when my mother got a Canon for Christmas. From that point forward, it was something that I wanted to get into, something I wanted to be good at.  In 2018, I bought my first camera and spent the next several years traveling around the country and the world, taking thousands of photos, with the hopes that I could one day share them, and have them inspire others, like that camera inspired me. On this website, I have showcased some of what I feel are the best photos that I have taken over the past four and a half years. I know you will enjoy and appreciate them as much as I do!

        On this page of my portfolio I have showcased some of my favorite landscape photos from some of the most beautiful places on earth. Such as the Rocky Mountains of Western Colorado, the Andes of Peru, and the Bisti Wilderness of New Mexico. In my travels to all of these amazing places, I have discovered a common theme, that beauty can be found everywhere you go, sometimes in the unlikeliest of places.

        On this page of my portfolio, I have showcased some of my favorite wildlife photos from some of the travels and excursions I have been on. Last year my father, uncle, and I flew up Alaska to photograph the local bear population. We had the amazing opportunity to see and photograph these bears from incredibly close, sometimes within just a few feet. Being able to get this close to these magnificent animals allowed me to capture both images and experiences that I will never forget, and my hope is that you might experience a bit through these photographs.

                <p class="paragraph-text">Welcome to my photography page! I picked up my first camera more than 15 years ago when my mother got a Canon for Christmas. From that point forward, it was something that I wanted to get into, something I wanted to be good at.  In 2018, I bought my first camera and spent the next several years traveling around the country and the world, taking thousands of photos, with the hopes that I could one day share them, and have them inspire others, like that camera inspired me. On this website, I have showcased some of what I feel are the best photos that I have taken over the past four and a half years. I know you will enjoy and appreciate them as much as I do!</p>
